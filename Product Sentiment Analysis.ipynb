I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home.\",1\\r\\n3,5,31-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,\"I have had a lot of fun with this thing.

Can’t wait to see what else it can do.\",1\\r\\n6,3,31-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,\"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.\",1\\r\\n7,5,31-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I think this is the 5th one I\\'ve purchased. I\\'m working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.,1\\r\\n8,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,looks great,1\\r\\n9,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,\"Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information!

She does make me laugh at times,1\\r\\n12,5,30-Jul-18,Oak Finish ,\"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!\",1\\r\\n13,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,\"Love, Love, Love!!\",1\\r\\n14,5,30-Jul-18,Oak Finish ,Just what I expected....,1\\r\\n15,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,\"I love it, wife hates it.\",1\\r\\n16,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.,1\\r\\n17,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.,1\\r\\n18,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound,1\\r\\n19,4,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,\"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it\\'s just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what\\'s not to like? :)\",1\\r\\n20,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.,1\\r\\n21,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,\"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We\\'re sure we\\'ll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it\\'s a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn\\'t understand what we\\'re saying.\",1\\r\\n22,4,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,\"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music.

It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask,1\\r\\n24,3,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,\"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.\",1\\r\\n25,5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,Amazing product,1\\r\\n26,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,\"I love my Echo.

Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great\",1\\r\\n33,3,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I\\'ve done it correctly but they won\\'t sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.,1\\r\\n34,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,This device is awesome!,1\\r\\n35,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.,1\\r\\n36,5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,\"Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube.\",1\\r\\n37,4,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo,1\\r\\n38,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,\"This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is.\",1\\r\\n39,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,\"This is my first digital assistant so I\\'m giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That\\'s what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven\\'t had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!\",1\\r\\n40,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it\\'s capabilities,1\\r\\n41,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,\"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell.

Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.,1\\r\\n46,2,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,\"It\\'s like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don\\'t see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.\",0\\r\\n47,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.,1\\r\\n48,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,I love you so much,1\\r\\n49,3,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .,1\\r\\n50,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,\"Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español.\",1\\r\\n51,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,\"I\\'m still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great!

It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.\",1\\r\\n77,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!,1\\r\\n78,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I LIKE IT ALL,1\\r\\n79,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I love it. It does everything,1\\r\\n80,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I\\'m not really Tech savvy.

I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It\\'s fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I\\'ve been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.\",1\\r\\n95,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,\"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.\",1\\r\\n96,5,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it\\'s great!,1\\r\\n97,5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,\"Love the Echo !!!

Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn\\'t rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue.

However, I can\\'t make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.

Finally Amazon enables the “drop-in” feature so now I can use my Echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house (and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner).As for its other features, we mainly use our Echos for the standard stuff: playing music, setting alarms, answering questions, etc. It\\'s not the life-changing home device Amazon would have you believe, but it is convenient to have around. This refurb saved me a few bucks, looks and works the same as the other brand-new ones.\",1\\r\\n452,5,3-Jul-18,Black,Love it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo. It is awesome have used it for everything my lights since I work nights and shopping as well as for my spotify.

I would recommend this to everyone!!!!,1\\r\\n453,5,3-Jul-18,Black,Love Alexa hope have her in every room soon.,1\\r\\n454,5,3-Jul-18,White,The simplicity of use and setting up.,1\\r\\n455,5,2-Jul-18,Black,This is great!

It can answer a variety of questions. I would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder, but I can\\'t complain.I also believe it should have an internal power source. In order to use the Echo, it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord. It would be nice to use the Echo Dot on the go without having to buy the other product.\",1\\r\\n460,5,2-Jul-18,Black,Love it!  Great fun!,1\\r\\n461,5,2-Jul-18,Black,Love it!,1\\r\\n462,5,2-Jul-18,White,outstanding I use all the time....works just like they say,1\\r\\n463,5,2-Jul-18,White,\"saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less, because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected.\",1\\r\\n464,5,1-Jul-18,Black,\"Works perfectly, Alexa turns on and off my lights, my tv, roomba!\",1\\r\\n465,5,1-Jul-18,Black,Never would know it was refurbished.,1\\r\\n466,3,1-Jul-18,Black,So far so good,1\\r\\n467,5,1-Jul-18,Black,Looks and performs as new.

Certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. Instead this item crashed as soon as I turned it on and plugged it in. When trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. Not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. Alexa would tell me it’s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. Tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn’t do anything. Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it.\",0\\r\\n471,5,30-Jun-18,Black,\"Very fast service,  got what I ordered.

I would highly recommended instead of purchasing new.,1\\r\\n481,5,27-Jun-18,Black,I got this for my mom . She loves it !,1\\r\\n482,5,27-Jun-18,Black,I love my echo dot! Looks brand new and works perfect! Very satisfied.,1\\r\\n483,5,27-Jun-18,Black,Same as new,1\\r\\n484,4,27-Jun-18,White,\"A small problem out of the box, but a rep from Amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues. I was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!? (lol)I think GF is worried that if Alexa learns to cook, her time will be limited...\",1\\r\\n485,4,27-Jun-18,Black,\"I love my Alexa Dot. I play games with my son, ask how the weather Is and I love that she works with my Amazon Fire Tv.\",1\\r\\n486,5,26-Jun-18,Black,I like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn\\'t sometimes I have to reset it I don\\'t know if it\\'s because it\\'s refurbished but it\\'s okay it\\'s just not what I expected,1\\r\\n487,5,26-Jun-18,Black,\"So far the certified refurbished Echo Dot works well. It was a little confusing to have a green ring on the Echo Dot and not 100% know why it was there. Asked Alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. But that was not the case. Took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that I had a delivery from amazon. I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed.\",1\\r\\n488,5,26-Jun-18,Black,It arrived quickly and was easy to set up ! it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what I expected ! Alexa and I have become buddies she is a great assistant,1\\r\\n489,5,26-Jun-18,Black,\"Works as advertised. Speak clearly, and research the commands. Also. Get the wall holder, it keeps it out of the way. Set up is a breeze, just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone. For some reason it made set up easier...though it could be psychological haha\",1\\r\\n490,4,26-Jun-18,Black,Love my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker.  The return process still isn\\'t done and has already taken weeks.,1\\r\\n491,1,26-Jun-18,Black,I\\'ve already returned it.,0\\r\\n492,5,25-Jun-18,Black,\"The refurbished echo for has been wonderful.

It\\'s been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems\",1\\r\\n493,4,25-Jun-18,Black,\"Works good. However, the price went down the week after I purchased it.\",1\\r\\n494,5,25-Jun-18,Black,Works amazingly. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it.,1\\r\\n495,5,25-Jun-18,Black,\"I love Alexa!

We showering.,1\\r\\n497,5,25-Jun-18,Black,I have 3-Dots and 2-Original and this new one works perfectly.  Will buy all my future Dots reconditioned.,1\\r\\n498,4,25-Jun-18,Black,Was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all,1\\r\\n499,1,25-Jun-18,Black,\"Now I\\'m weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  I have 3-4, so this is very concerning.  I wish Amazon would release something widespread  or push some firmware to prevent this.  If they have, I have not heard about it yet.\",0\\r\\n500,5,24-Jun-18,Black,There\\'s really no dislike for Alexa( dot) I thought cortna was cool but Alexa is an awesome application to the family. Unbelievable device which seems alive. A must get.,1\\r\\n501,5,24-Jun-18,White,\"I am happy with the refurbished echo dot. I’ve had it for about two weeks, and so far it is working perfectly!

The replacement was registered to someone else. When the price of the Dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones), I bought a brand, spanking new one. No problem with the new one.\",0\\r\\n505,5,24-Jun-18,Black,Works as expected!,1\\r\\n506,5,23-Jun-18,Black,No problems,1\\r\\n507,5,23-Jun-18,Black,Have these in almost every room. I really have enjoyed them.

Just like new!,1\\r\\n515,5,21-Jun-18,Black,\"Loved the price for an essentially brand new Dot!! Opening it, you really couldn’t tell that it was refurbished. Everything looked brand new.

I own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there’s a SIGNIFICANT difference in sound. The dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it’s coming off a cheap portable speaker. I was REALLY disappointed. I returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also.\",1\\r\\n548,5,14-Jun-18,Black,\"Took me awhile to get it connected.

Planning on getting another one for the Amazon Fire Stick in bedroom.,1\\r\\n558,1,12-Jun-18,Black,\"Stopped working after 7 months. The warranty was only good for 3 months. I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?\",0\\r\\n559,5,12-Jun-18,White,\"Just like new. No problems whatsoever, Alexa. Thank you.\",1\\r\\n560,3,12-Jun-18,Black,I like my uncle.

He had to return it.,0\\r\\n562,1,12-Jun-18,Black,Bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months. Hard and soft reset will not fix the problem.,0\\r\\n563,3,12-Jun-18,Black,\"I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone’s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me.\",1\\r\\n564,5,11-Jun-18,Black,I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.,1\\r\\n565,5,11-Jun-18,Black,Worked like new.  Will do it again.,1\\r\\n566,2,11-Jun-18,Black,The second one which was a refurbished model did work-at least not in my home.,0\\r\\n567,1,11-Jun-18,White,\"Very bad this device, I don’t know if it’s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking.

It works good.Some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times, some time almost screaming.\",1\\r\\n571,5,11-Jun-18,Black,\"I took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for $29. Looks brand new...no excuses or disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the Alexa App on my iPhone was flawless. Listening to my favorite tunes through a Bose Bluetooth setup and couldn\\'t be happier. Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80\\'s music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box!

Glad I did, and will probably buy another refurb product form Amazon. I love the Alexa products and have several. This one sits on my desk. Has a small footprint, but has great sound and I use it daily. Works great.\",1\\r\\n601,3,5-Jun-18,Black,Not bad bad speaker for sound,1\\r\\n602,4,5-Jun-18,Black,\"This is a great device. We mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to Red Alert or make the TARDIS land (yes, we\\'re a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;Computer&#34; instead of &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now we just need Majel Barret\\'s voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It\\'s not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it\\'s still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. Plus it\\'s fun knowing the NSA is listening to everything.\",1\\r\\n603,5,5-Jun-18,Black,We all love her!,1\\r\\n604,5,5-Jun-18,White,I purchased this for my daughter and we all love this!!!! its amazing!! we love the games!,1\\r\\n605,2,5-Jun-18,Black,It doesn’t always  work,0\\r\\n606,5,5-Jun-18,White,Good as new!

Microphone is not as good as the better Echo products,1\\r\\n615,5,2-Jun-18,Black,Took a little work to set up but I finally got it.  Sound quality not the best but for what I got it for it works great.  I check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it.  I do play the radio on it when I want some music but will probably upgrade to the Echo plus for better sound.,1\\r\\n616,5,1-Jun-18,Black,Love Alexa these are the best thing I have ever bought don\\'t know how I ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to,1\\r\\n617,5,1-Jun-18,White,I loved it it works great,1\\r\\n618,1,31-May-18,White,Extremely low in volume,0\\r\\n619,4,31-May-18,Black,\"I had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone. I ended up using my computer. It is interesting that the answers come from Wikipedia. However, I will give Echo dot an &#34;A&#34; in the music playing department. I heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations. Also amusing when Alexa responds, I don\\'t know that. Why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing???? If I had paid full price for this gadget I would have been sorely disappointed. Now it seems reasonable and a step above HAL.\",1\\r\\n620,1,31-May-18,White,\"Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn\\'t have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn\\'t connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it\\'s just not as strong.\",0\\r\\n621,1,31-May-18,Black,\"If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE.

It was bought for a workout room, and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine. It could use a much better speaker.\",1\\r\\n625,5,31-May-18,White,Works great and simple to set up. Alexa is way more accurate than I imagined so Im using it more than I thought. Wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.No she\\'s not listening when you don\\'t say the wake word so if you\\'re worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. The speaker is great too so don\\'t hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.,1\\r\\n626,5,31-May-18,Black,The voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :),1\\r\\n627,5,31-May-18,White,Worked perfect,1\\r\\n628,4,30-May-18,White,\"Had a little trouble at the beginning until I replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times Alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees!  Like when it was 91 degrees, Alexa would say it was 81 degrees.  Otherwise, everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from Amazon and my Pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist.\",1\\r\\n629,5,30-May-18,Black,I bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly. If they weren\\'t labeled as refurbished I wouldn\\'t have known,1\\r\\n630,5,30-May-18,Black,\"This device works perfectly and was a good price.  We love Alexa and are having great fun with her.  The music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our morning traffic report.  I didn’t think I would enjoy having AI in the house, but it is fun, educational and entertaining even for people who aren’t tech savvy.\",1\\r\\n631,1,30-May-18,White,Eh. It’s works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine,0\\r\\n632,5,30-May-18,White,Great little thing. Works better than siri.,1\\r\\n633,5,29-May-18,Black,It’s amazing I love it,1\\r\\n634,5,28-May-18,Black,Bought this for my son and he loves it.,1\\r\\n635,4,28-May-18,White,\"I own the first and second generation Echo Dot.  I think I prefer the volume ring of the first gen better than the buttons on the second gen, but still more than does the job and great for the price I got it for.  I\\'d still definitely recommend.\",1\\r\\n636,5,28-May-18,Black,Very fun to use and having morning briefing,1\\r\\n637,5,28-May-18,Black,Arrived on time and works amazing!!!,1\\r\\n638,5,28-May-18,White,\"Just like new, set-up was quick & easy.\",1\\r\\n639,5,28-May-18,Black,\"like new, good refurbishing\",1\\r\\n640,5,28-May-18,Black,Love it,1\\r\\n641,4,27-May-18,Black,Love my echo dot!!!,1\\r\\n642,5,27-May-18,Black,I like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn\\'t wireless and the volume is not that high.,1\\r\\n643,5,27-May-18,White,great product!,1\\r\\n644,3,27-May-18,Black,\"It works great, but the reason I\\'m leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time. Pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available.\",1\\r\\n645,5,27-May-18,White,Works great!,1\\r\\n646,5,27-May-18,Black,I love it ita like having a personal assistant and computer and everything else in one.,1\\r\\n647,5,27-May-18,Black,\"The problem I have with this item could just be my inexperience. I ordered the wrong thing, but then decided I’d set it up and use Alexa. I was trying to replace a small Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom. Thought I could learn as I go. I downloaded the app, but never could get the Echo to sync with my iPhone. I’ve decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended.\",1\\r\\n648,5,27-May-18,Black,Es perfecto.,1\\r\\n649,5,27-May-18,Black,Working good so far.,1\\r\\n650,5,27-May-18,Black,Working great and my daughter loves it!,1\\r\\n651,5,26-May-18,Black,Works great,1\\r\\n652,5,26-May-18,White,I love it,1\\r\\n653,1,26-May-18,White,\"I wanted a white dot for my white bathroom.

The next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app. I am not sure if it just this Dot or they are all this way.,0\\r\\n672,5,22-May-18,White,Bought this to go in my niece\\'s room. You can\\'t tell it\\'s refurbished. It looks good and works like new.,1\\r\\n673,1,21-May-18,White,Device was not working. Followed all instructions for Alexa echo dot and it did not come on. Very upsetting.,0\\r\\n674,1,21-May-18,Black,Sent it back due to crackling noise and turning itself off and on - but what can you expect with a refurbished item?,0\\r\\n675,5,20-May-18,White,Best price we could find and it is so useful to have her around to answer questions. It is so handy to not have to find your phone. I also now have an intercom system.,1\\r\\n676,5,20-May-18,Black,I have never been more satisfied with a product. Perfect introduction to Alexa.,1\\r\\n677,4,20-May-18,Black,\"Works well, but the speaker is not so grand. Getting another speaker to drop this into.

Wonder if this has something to do with buying it refurbished. Our google home mini has no problems hearing us 😬 and is much louder.,1\\r\\n682,5,19-May-18,White,Love it!  Works perfectly!,1\\r\\n683,4,19-May-18,White,I had a brand new echo Dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good. It was quite different from my expectations. Refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while I realized that the power adapter was faulty. There is no way for me to have Amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options. I love Amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down.Update: Amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter. This is why I shop on Amazon. I can always trust them to deliver on their products.,1\\r\\n684,5,19-May-18,Black,I bought this for a family member as a gift. I called her to see how she likes it & she said she loves it‼️,1\\r\\n685,4,18-May-18,Black,\"Not very loud but quality and ease of use is great.

My daughter and I just asked questions on the first day. I have now set my daily alarm, weekend reminder, playlist, morning shows, random songs, daily bible verses, weather, and morning commute. It tells me which way to go dodging traffic. You have to get one. I don’t have it linked to my phone yet.\",1\\r\\n693,5,17-May-18,White,Works perfect! There’s no difference at all between this refurb one and my new ones that I have in my house. I’ll be buying the refurbs from here on out,1\\r\\n694,5,17-May-18,Black,Great product.

It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.

Still needs a little improvement on sound,1\\r\\n714,4,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,\"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it\\'s just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what\\'s not to like? :)\",1\\r\\n715,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.,1\\r\\n716,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,\"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists.

I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I\\'ve done it correctly but they won\\'t sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.,1\\r\\n729,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,This device is awesome!,1\\r\\n730,5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.,1\\r\\n731,5,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,\"Love my Echo.

Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn\\'t.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can\\'t make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.\",1\\r\\n950,5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,We are loving Ours very much,1\\r\\n951,5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,\"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best.

The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo.

Very fun to learn how to use it.,1\\r\\n1050,5,31-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos,1\\r\\n1051,4,31-Jul-18,White  Spot,\"Don’t use it for much as I thought we would. Synced with Kasa-Cam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot. Lyrics for music is cool, too. Other than that it’s used as a clock and standard dot’ish features.\",1\\r\\n1052,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Amazing so far. Just got it the other day.,1\\r\\n1053,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I like that it\\'s smaller, but it has never understood commands as easily as our first-gen original Echo did.\",1\\r\\n1054,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Worthy successor to the echo dot and right at home in the bed room as an alarm clock.  However, for the price it should come with the stand\",1\\r\\n1055,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I love this device! All the functionality of an Amazon Echo with the added benefit of a video screen. It looks great on my nightstand as a clock (lots of faces to choose from) and displays weather, reminders, etc. I think it can do video calls too but I use FaceTime for that anyway. It’s a great shape and doesn’t take up a lot of room. I’m planning to get another one for my guest room. Awesome for a great price!\",1\\r\\n1056,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,I love the Echo Spot. This bedside alarm clock size device can do what theEcho Show can do. I was concerned because I already had a large Echo in mybedroom that answered to “Alexa” like the other devices in my home. I wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when I discoveredthat I had other name choices (not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion).I named him “Echo.” Now if I could only choose a male voice. I loved that I could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell. So many more features. Don’t forget to buy thestand/base. So many advantages to having that. Read the reviews. Highly recommend.,1\\r\\n1057,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I love this little Spot more than I thought I would. The sound is great for such a little thing...my music plays nice and loud and clear. The video is terrific...I was watching some Prime shows just for the heck of it, and I was really impressed. Immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday!Only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars...I really wish it was cordless. I love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain. And it won’t connect to my Bluetooth speaker while playing Amazon Prime Music for some reason, which is a drag when I want to hear it in the dining room during dinner. Of course, if it was CORDLESS I could just bring it with me...otherwise, I absolutely love it and will probably buy another one!\",1\\r\\n1058,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I bought on Prime Day and so glad I did. It’s easy to use and lots of customization options. I know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read, but I disagree.\",1\\r\\n1059,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Honestly I like it but at the same time I don’t I could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half I bought it for the video chat and I have never really used it,0\\r\\n1060,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Overall it\\'s great and I like that I can see lyrics and the time and  date. However, sometimes it freezes and doesn\\'t respond properly--no error message about lack of connectivity--it just stops. Resetting resolves the problem.\",1\\r\\n1061,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I love all that you can do with the Echo Spot!,1\\r\\n1062,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,The thing I like most about my Echo Spot is the voice command feature.  You can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the Echo. Easy to use,1\\r\\n1063,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,\"Love it!! Perfect for an alarm clock replacement, plus so much more!!\",1\\r\\n1064,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I love the Echo Spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things, but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom!\",1\\r\\n1065,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,We absolutely love this product!!! Wish we would have bought this instead of the dots!!!,1\\r\\n1066,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,\"We like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly.  You can even hear music played. The speaker is clear.  We are enjoying it.  What we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me.  The next day, I asked the Echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song.  The Echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before.  It was a little disconcerting.\",1\\r\\n1067,4,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,\"I like echo spot. I bought it to use as an alarm clock. One negative that i didnt really think about, when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy, its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm, or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes. In this case a clock with buttons seems to work better\",1\\r\\n1068,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,This is our second Echo Spot - to go with out two Echo Dots - love the look and how Alexia responds.,1\\r\\n1069,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Love my Echo Spot!,1\\r\\n1070,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,It is very slow compared to the echo,0\\r\\n1071,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,I love the way it is designed. And you have choices for the face.  I use it for my bed side.  I drop in; on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling.,1\\r\\n1072,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Terrific sound for a small device, and nice form factor for the nightstand. I like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking Alexa. Not using video much, but it would be nice if the device had a square/rectangular screen.\",1\\r\\n1073,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,New to Alexa. Like this spot a lot.,1\\r\\n1074,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"It\\'s not perfect, but I really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. A bonus has been getting Alexa to play music from my Amazon Prime playlists.What\\'s not so great is that sometimes Alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating. Hopefully the AI gets better in the future, along with added functions.\",1\\r\\n1075,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,I love it.  It is so easy to use,1\\r\\n1076,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm. Works great. Every morning I get the weather and news when I get up. Also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and I have.,1\\r\\n1077,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Love it,1\\r\\n1078,3,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,\"Part of it is my fault, I thought it could be wireless.  Though for the price, I still feel like it should be. Also the sound quality and volume could be better. I prefer the tap. Unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones, computers or iPads. Just not worth it.\",1\\r\\n1079,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Very easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone.,1\\r\\n1080,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I love my new Echo Spot!,1\\r\\n1081,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I love this clock, I just have to tell it to set my alarm.  No more fussing with buttons!\",1\\r\\n1082,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Couldn\\'t be more pleased. Amazon hit this one out of the park. Looks great and runs great. Love it!,1\\r\\n1083,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,Responds easily and like the ability to do at night.,1\\r\\n1084,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Easy setup  Love it!,1\\r\\n1085,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,\"Simply amazing what a awsome device. It never ceases to amaze me, wake up to big bang music, go to sleep softly falling rain. Drop in on the kids and keep in touch. I have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do.\",1\\r\\n1086,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I was skeptical at first but &#34;it&#34; grows on you.  It looks good, so far.  I did, however, turn off the camera.\",1\\r\\n1087,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Sound quality is disappointing.,1\\r\\n1088,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,I love it!  I especially love that it is so small and does so much.  Got rid of my old CD/Alarm clock radio.  Much more room on nightstand.,1\\r\\n1089,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,Great sound and video plus all the great stuff that Alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off,1\\r\\n1090,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,The ease to use product,1\\r\\n1091,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"So far pretty happy with the Spot. For me it really is a glorified alarm clock/radio and I know I could have something more cost effective but eh, I like it. I had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did. So far so good.\",1\\r\\n1092,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I am just entering the &#34;smart&#34; technology world. I haven\\'t figured it all out yet, but so far it\\'s pretty cool!\",1\\r\\n1093,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"It was smaller than I had anticipated, and when I say that I very much mean it. However, it still works very well! Quality sound, easily programmed, easy to work with, but Alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs.\",1\\r\\n1094,1,30-Jul-18,White  Spot, ,0\\r\\n1095,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,Love my Echo Spot!,1\\r\\n1096,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Great deal, great product!\",1\\r\\n1097,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Perfect,1\\r\\n1098,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"i had a couple of echo dots previously - bought these _SPECIFICALLY_ for the Ring doorbell video / cloud cam display / interface capabilities. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. Love the fact that I can ask to see front yard / back yard / front door, etc.the video chat with the other rooms is also quite cool.BONUS: “Alexa show me Ant Man trailer, etc”i know this can all be done on laptop/desktop, but it’s cool now having an ‘appliance’ that’s always just there, and it doesn’t interrupt what i’m doing.\",1\\r\\n1099,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,\"Bought this for my bedroom and the Show for my living room. Love them both. The Spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design. Shows lyrics, photos , etc. I paired it with a Smart Plug for the bedroom lamps &#34;Alexa, turn off lights&#34;, love it.\",1\\r\\n1100,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Love that is can do so much! It sits on my nightstand! Only improvements I would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger. But overall I’m happy I have it! Would recommend!,1\\r\\n1101,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,It was a gift and the recipient love love loves it 😍💋💋💋💋❤!,1\\r\\n1102,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Cool little piece of tech...we’re still learning some of its functions and possibilities, but I can see some potential.  Even my ‘technically challenged’ wife already figured out how to video call our daughter.\",1\\r\\n1103,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole. Completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock. It is the perfect bedside counter device - alarm, wake up music, weather, top news stories, etc. Perfect device for what I wanted and does so much more than I expected it to do, calling feature is also a huge selling point. This is a must own item. Probably will grab more Echos in the future.\",1\\r\\n1104,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"As an Alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t go up from there.  The ability to play videos is very limited.  You CAN NOT play YouTube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can\\'t turn off the &#34;Things to try&#34; screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don\\'t need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don\\'t need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that\\'s not very useful and annoying.  I would not recommend this until the Amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that\\'s actually useful.\",0\\r\\n1105,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,So far so good.,1\\r\\n1106,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"This device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock. I love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room. Its the first nightstand clock I have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep. The screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all.Overall a great addition to my smart home. Its nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn on/off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone. I have a bunch of other Alexa devices, but this was the first one with a screen.\",1\\r\\n1107,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,\"I love this thing. I talk to it through walls and in other rooms. I have been an amazon lover for a while so I have amazon music unlimited, kindle unlimited, prime video, etc., so I was ready for this when it came out. The screen is just so nice to have.The only thing resembling a down side is that it doesn\\'t always perfectly understand which song I want to hear, but I do have a deep southern accent, lower Alabama, so I don\\'t speak English anyways.\",1\\r\\n1108,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Smaller than I thought it would be. Happy I got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table.,1\\r\\n1109,4,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,Echo Spot works well except it does not work with the Ring doorbell as it states on the website. Since they were sold as a pair I thought that it would be app ready.  Unfortunately that is not case.  Perhaps Ring will update so that they can be integrated.,1\\r\\n1110,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Nice,1\\r\\n1111,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I like it,1\\r\\n1112,1,30-Jul-18,White  Spot, ,0\\r\\n1113,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,\"We\\'ve owned a number of Echo devices, but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool.  Other than playing music through a sound system, we haven\\'t found much use for them.  We just don\\'t find the voice user interface to be all that efficient.  The Echo Spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you\\'re routinely interested in.  Furthermore, you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings.  We now use these as bedside clocks.\",1\\r\\n1114,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,I love my Echo Spot.  Waking to my favorite music.  Being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark.  All the skills I have yet to try.  Easy to use.,1\\r\\n1115,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I like how small it is, but I’m still able to see my Ring cameras.\",1\\r\\n1116,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Great for checking in on my son after school when I\\'m still at work.  Love getting the weather and traffic in the morning so I can plan my route accordingly,1\\r\\n1117,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Love it!! Super fun! Easy to use! My three year old even gets involved,1\\r\\n1118,1,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,I returnef this item because it does not speak Spanish,0\\r\\n1119,1,29-Jul-18,White  Spot, ,0\\r\\n1120,4,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I am a hardcore fan of Echo. Infact I am in love with all members of my Alexa family. I have Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and now this new toddler Echo Spot. Every variant has its own beauty. I love feel and size of Echo Spot. It’s fabulous as far as looks are concerned. It does not have great Audio quality (which I did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size). I bought it to connect with my Bose SoundTouch.\",1\\r\\n1121,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Love this!,1\\r\\n1122,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I love being able to have Alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up.,1\\r\\n1123,3,29-Jul-18,White  Spot,\"Works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for Alexa doesn\\'t work as well as the normal Echo.  Sometimes Alexa doesn\\'t hear me when I try to interrupt her it to give new instructions.  The speaker also isn\\'t as good as the normal Echo.  Screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who\\'s at the front door.  But, it\\'s great for the bedside.\",1\\r\\n1124,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Fun tech toy,1\\r\\n1125,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Love it. Small with good sound,1\\r\\n1126,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"With the combination of this, smart plugins, and the Alex app I can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling Alexa to do it. I can order stuff, get answers, watch videos, get weather, set alarms, video call, and so much more with this device!\",1\\r\\n1127,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Great product,1\\r\\n1128,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"In a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house. Extrimelly useful hub of information, music, automation, communication, and assistant in basic needs. Would love to have a voice personalization. Some things are better not to said aloud but typed (like door unlocking codes) but that is problem of unwitty developers. So far only positive experience. The privacy invasions is happened way before Alexa, it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier. To Alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off.\",1\\r\\n1129,4,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I love this device! It\\'s so great. What a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker! Only reason I didn\\'t give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing YouTube videos, and Google play music. The camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and it\\'s dark in the room.Other than those minor things, I love it. Great buy and would buy again\",1\\r\\n1130,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Hands free control,1\\r\\n1131,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Great love the display and easy to use, though still learning what all it can do everyday.\",1\\r\\n1132,4,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"It has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start, even from a distance. A lot of the skills are excellent. I\\'ve added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it\\'s ridiculous that it can\\'t access YouTube.It might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task; it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event. I imagine this is a functionality people would use often.\",1\\r\\n1133,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Setup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock,1\\r\\n1134,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Great product! Highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it, it sits much better on the desk.\",1\\r\\n1135,3,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Eh it’s cool and all but also kinda boring I don’t really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 3/5 is about right. I can’t connect to my Spotify unless it’s premium and I’m in college and I’m not paying or that or amazon music so,1\\r\\n1136,3,29-Jul-18,White  Spot,I am huge Amazon fan! First to have a kindle and the echo. I waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile. I do love it!! My kids love it! They love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs. Now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out. I thought as long as someone would FaceTime me I could do it through that and I can’t. It’s Spot to Spot. Can’t even Skype (which I do often with my aunt). The is my major disappointment with it.,1\\r\\n1137,5,29-Jul-18,White  Spot,LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE. The only think I notice is that it doesn\\'t pick-up my voice and commands as well as my Echo and Echo Dots (we have 4 Echo products throughout our house). I have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock. I\\'m no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists!!!!,1\\r\\n1138,5,29-Jul-18,White  Spot,Love my Amazon products,1\\r\\n1139,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Love this,1\\r\\n1140,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Love my spot.

The screen is a major plus.,1\\r\\n1145,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Didnt think id get an Alexa device, but this is perfect for my home office.  the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other Alexa devices.  It can show lyrics of songs, play my xm radio, can show videos of movie trailers and news.  Its great!\",1\\r\\n1146,5,29-Jul-18,White  Spot,I love it.  I made a group with my echo dot so I get music through my home.  I am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully I can get another spot for my bedroom..  I love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice..,1\\r\\n1147,1,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"When we first received this product, it was great.  However, about a week ago, the device served up a video advertisement around 10:30pm at night and scared myself and my family.

I think it still is a little expensive, but the chance to save $30 convinced me to buy it. I basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly. I also like the sleep sounds skill, and hearing the weather. I\\'m still exploring the other skills...just discovered some Star Trek sounds (Alexa, beam me up) which are fun!\",1\\r\\n1153,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Love this!

Great size for a bedroom!,1\\r\\n1155,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,So far so good. Just got it and I am trying to figure out all the things it can do. The product itself is very well made..

May favorite Alexa device by far, specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cam\\'s it does the job really well.  We changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive.

Use it for music mostly.,1\\r\\n1159,3,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,It won’t receive calls and it’s really hard to call someone who has another echo.,1\\r\\n1160,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,This is our first step into a smart home.

Music sound is very good not as good as the Echo but way better than our Dots.  If we could only buy 1 Amazon device it would be the Spot.,1\\r\\n1171,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I bought two one for my office and one for my bedside table. They are fantastic the screen is just big enough when using the drop in feature to communicate with my mom.

I like it. My only complaint is the very short instructions,1\\r\\n1187,4,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Big step up from the Dot! Dropped one star due to consistent delay in bringing up Ring Pro video, though looks great once the feed is displayed.\",1\\r\\n1188,5,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,Easy set up and to use. I bought two one for my house and one for my 75 year old grandfather.

Plus it dims at night!!,1\\r\\n1191,4,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I love it and it works great, the only issue is the “drop in” FaceTime like feature sometimes lags, but that could possibly be an issue with my WiFi for where we have it located in the house.\",1\\r\\n1192,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Love to have meditation music, I use it as a morning alarm, just to mention few in general I love it\",1\\r\\n1193,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I don\\'t know why I like it, but I do. It\\'s like an all-in-one alarm clock.  If you have other alexa devices, you know what it is.  If you are looking to get an alarm clock, this is the one to get (yes, its much more than that).  It shows you the time, it shows you the weather, its touch screen, it shows you music lyrics, and it does all the things your typical alexa device does.  It\\'s quite loud for its size as well (sound way better than echo dot).  It also does video calling, which is pretty awesome.  The viewing angle is great, so even if its sitting fairly high up, you can still see the display well enough.\",1\\r\\n1194,5,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,Quick and easy to set up,1\\r\\n1195,3,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement .  The display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this task.The display works well for camera viewing.It is an attractive device. and a decent value at $99,1\\r\\n1196,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Great device,1\\r\\n1197,4,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I’m a fan of echo devices. I think it’s a great alternative to a clean clock. I like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep. My two year old sleeps so much better with it on. We also use it to tell my two year old stories. Only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night,1\\r\\n1198,5,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,\"I own 5 Echo devices, consider me addicted! This little number is awesome, not only do I like that it displays, the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other Echo devices. One feature I really like is how it slowly dims after I turn off my bedroom light, so I have a night light for a bit. I love Echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them!\",1\\r\\n1199,5,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,I enjoy this little thing a lot.  Will do almost anything.  I like the jokes it tells.

It fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show. I like going to sleep with the lightening storm. The images along with the sounds are very relaxing. The calling and messaging feature is great. It’s small enough to take with when we travel. I love and own most of the Alexa products. Our whole family uses them.,1\\r\\n1205,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,The amazon Alexa is so nice to have she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and is great if you have prime because she can do a lot more plays any songs you want her to play and she can even make playlists of your favorite songs i love the Alexa because she has games you can play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen!,1\\r\\n1206,5,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,love the spot,1\\r\\n1207,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Easy to use easy to set up,1\\r\\n1208,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I love my echo spot that my daughter and son in law got me for my birthday. Alexa wakes me each morning and plays music when I ask.,1\\r\\n1209,1,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,\"This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) There is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- it\\'s an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) By default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. My unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time.

I had the Echo Dot on my nightstand, but I really missed a display. This is perfect and the speakers are excellent.\",1\\r\\n1215,4,27-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Yes it met my expectations.  The snooze on the alarm needs a but of work.  Tap it and it snoozes, swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss.  But without my glasses I can\\'t read it and often it just snoozes.  Then one day I must have dismissed tomorrow\\'s alarm because it never went off.  I have it set for Mon-Thu.  Fri I don\\'t need to get up early.  A more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice.  My old alarm had a red light.\",1\\r\\n1216,5,27-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Great product, and i like the screen for a alarm clock\",1\\r\\n1217,5,27-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"Such a fun, easy, and convenient device to have around the house. No need to pick up my phone to look something up, just a few words and the world is at your fingertips. The speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp. The price is right for a device like this.\",1\\r\\n1218,4,27-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"A great replacement for the bedside alarm clock, which had a funny habit of going off at 12am every time the cleaning ladies came through. We mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off, while leaving the fan running. Only gripe would be the mic sensitivity, which doesn\\'t appear be as good as the View or Gen2. It can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself.\",1\\r\\n1219,5,27-Jul-18,White  Spot,This product has made my life much simpler with a little one. I use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it on/off or up/down is a breeze.

I love the sleek look of the Echo Spot on my nightstand and how easy it was to set up and use. I also love that it scrolls the news, local weather, and give suggestions of what to ask Alexa.

Sometimes she doesn\\'t answer but I think it has to do when internet is low or is updating or my voice isn\\'t strong. Over all I haven\\'t had any of the annoying stuff that everyone is complaining about. Thank goodness I didn\\'t listen to those reviews.

The small screen sucks for video as it is small and round but it’s nice to have something to show time and pictures.,1\\r\\n1232,5,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,Fun so far...still learning how it all works,1\\r\\n1233,5,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because I found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking, cutting, cleaning, etc. especially when our counters aren’t very wide to begin with. After going back and forth between this and the show I decided on this because I felt it had all the same features but is more compact. I can honestly say I have no regrets. While I probably wouldn’t watch a movie I’d been dying to see on this, it’s a great way to listen to music, watch a quick YouTube video, etc. I even attempted watching “Jaws” on this and while it wasn’t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn’t as bad as one would think. I would definitely recommend!\",1\\r\\n1234,5,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,We love the echo spot I use it on my nightstand for alarm clock and play iHeartRadio radio while getting dressed!!,1\\r\\n1235,5,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,It was easy set up.

Yes you can have it scroll once, and just stay on the clock, but I like having other cards as well. God its the worst and SO irritating.  I got it super cheap, so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a Dot instead of a Spot.

In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.

You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, Things to Try...  People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.Moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker.

The screen is big enough for me to easily read writing (this was a concern for me).  I loved this so much I purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools.

Honestly I didn\\'t really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn\\'t get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990\\'s and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot\\'s screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it\\'s hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don\\'t know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I\\'d love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can\\'t the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it\\'s a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I\\'m already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can\\'t tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.\",1\\r\\n1323,5,21-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"The screen response time is way better than I expected.

Already have a Show and a couple of full-sized Echo units in my house.The Spot is okay for what it is. Two issues, one minor and one major:-the minor one - why include the huge bezel on the front? Why not take that space and make the display larger? A total waste of usable space.-the major one, also involves the Show: I\\'m very used to these devices. I don\\'t need to see &#34;Things to Try&#34; whenever I use a voice command with it (even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices). I\\'m not a child and I don\\'t need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it. And having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed. Why doesn\\'t Amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off? I want to see a clock face, period, not these silly nanny reminders.\",1\\r\\n1330,5,20-Jul-18,Black  Spot,This product just looks adorable in any room and I love it.

I\\'ve been using for a couple months and if you\\'re an amazon prime subscriber the value here is greater than google. I\\'m using to listen to free music with prime (better than alternatives), audible and you can even watch movies. The display is a little small for lots of watching, the sound should be louder, and YOUTUBE NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE. These issues put this at a 3.5 to 4 stars. Fix one of them (youtube) and its a 5 star item. To alleviate sound I\\'ve paired with a blue tooth speaker. Right now this sits in my living area. Where I think it will shine is my office desk.

My biggest gripe about the device and why I knocked a star off is that you can\\'t turn off the suggestions on &#34;Things to Try&#34;. It \\'s an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you don\\'t want to see as it cycles through content screens.

I spoke to support and the wonderful lady tried and researched for 45 minutes to no avail. I am disappointed because I wanted that screen all the time not just during an occasional screen rotate.

I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn’t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying “Alexa set an alarm for 5am” and then having Alexa repeat “OK alarm set for 5am.”  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I’m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I’m in the shower.\",1\\r\\n1384,5,17-Jul-18,Black  Spot,I bought this for my mother and she loves it!

CREAPY AF,0\\r\\n1387,4,16-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"4 out of 5 stars. I have the Original Tall Echo, 4 dots, 2 spots and 1 Show.  The only thing I\\'m finding a problem with is the speakers in the Spot. when using Drop In.  Sometimes I\\'m not being heard on the other spot and vice versa.  The voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent. The optical is fine........ it\\'s just the sound. Sometimes I\\'ll have to repeat the wake word 2-3 times and I\\'m only 8 feet away plus it\\'s on one of those $20 stands.  I find the ECHO DOT, Original echo and the Show has much better sound quality.  That\\'s one reason I bought the Echo Show.\",1\\r\\n1388,5,16-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I bought this for my 90 year old grandmother and she and I love it!!! She can call all her family members with just her voice, play games, even watch a video and I love that I can “drop in” on her any time to see how she is doing. She lives all by herself.

Great!,1\\r\\n1397,5,15-Jul-18,White  Spot,I had just said to myself how I desired an assistant when I came across the Spot!  As a Mom of two things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyone’s schedules & my own. I just verbally tell Alexa what reminder or timer I need set and Voila!Having my Spot has given me the virtual assistant I so desired without having to actually hire someone.  Not to mention the many other awesome features. I have Alexa synced with my Audible & Kindle & Alex can read a book from my libraries to me.I’m still excited to see what else my Spot can do!Side note: I had wanted to purchase a Show for a while & probably still will down the line however I sooooo love my sleek little Sopt!,1\\r\\n1398,1,15-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I love the product , but very disappointed once I  realized I can no longer play youtube videos.

Glad I didn\\'t.\",0\\r\\n1399,5,15-Jul-18,Black  Spot,\"I’m not sure why or how Amazonia asking me about this purchase. I got it as a gift from my kids for Mother’s Day...

Unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because, as many have mentioned, it does not work with google or Youtube any more.  This problem is caused by Google because they came up with their own devices an no longer allow access from other devices like these.  This even effected my smart TV.

You don’t really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on FaceTime or Skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do I have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution.  I have also had problems with this device shutting down and I have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices.  Price difference is just not worth it,0\\r\\n1423,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,No you tube wouldn\\'t have bought it if I known that,0\\r\\n1424,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,This is our second echo show.  We have a home in Mexico and one in the USA.  Now when one of us is in the other home we can easily stay in touch and see each other.  We can also drop in on the houses when we aren’t there to check on them.  We use it to turn on and off the lights and security systems in both homes.  We also have echo dots in various rooms.  We love all this technology!  We ask her many questions and she plays music for us.,1\\r\\n1425,4,30-Jul-18,White  Show,Needs to play YouTube and prime video and maybe Netflix.

Love the flash briefing, the timers, the weather reports and more.\",1\\r\\n1432,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,We love the Show.  It loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an Show issue or our internet issue.  But overall we use it for many applications.,1\\r\\n1433,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,Works well with optional cameras.  Conferencing is good.  Still feel like Bezos is spying on me.,1\\r\\n1434,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,I can connect my smart lights and my phone. And any other smart device.

I love being able to not only hear, but now see, what I need on this device. I loved my regular echo, but the Show is just so much better!  It works wonderfully for music (especially paired with the Amazon music account) and is perfect with my ring doorbell. Love it!\",1\\r\\n1438,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,I absolutely LOVE this!!!  I have it in my kitchen so I can use it for cooking. The speakers are amazing!!!,1\\r\\n1439,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,I\\'ve only had this a week but so far so good.  We are enjoying it.,1\\r\\n1440,4,30-Jul-18,White  Show,\"Love the product idea. Super easy to set up & get started, a breeze to do routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items to shopping/to do lists, play music, get news, just about anything it\\'s supposed to do). The sound is good where Imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. There is one thing I HATE & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask Alexa. Unless you have her turn off the screen totally which I do when I go to bed. And it\\'s too bad bc it\\'s like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show was on sale prior to Prime day for less than the Echo, so I figured I was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. Because of the ever present script it\\'s not a nice device to look at, I would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the Echo. I may still exchange the product.\",1\\r\\n1441,4,30-Jul-18,White  Show,Very excited to see what it can do,1\\r\\n1442,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,\"This is great for music, video calling, kitchen timers, and probably a bunch more. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the ever-floating \"\"things to try\"\" on the home screen. This is purely an aesthetic complaint, but hopefully soon Amazon allows the option to shut it off.\",1\\r\\n1443,4,30-Jul-18,White  Show,\"I love the idea is the star trek computer at home. The skills are great, but the natural language work is mediocre.\",1\\r\\n1444,5,30-Jul-18,White  Show,\"Got this as a gift... so cool!  I can view my news, recipes or shopping lists.  And much more!!!\",1\\r\\n1445,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,\"I do love it. Was easy to set up so far, but I wish it has a little more in the set up instructions.

I have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home office.It is amazing for a quick look up while I am working. I live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointments.I will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family. The gift of organization and information at a voice command away.,1\\r\\n1447,1,30-Jul-18,White  Show, ,0\\r\\n1448,1,30-Jul-18,White  Show,\"Don\\'t waste your money.  I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of voice recognition that the Echo Show.  In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  I\\'ve worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  Finally, the screen just doesn\\'t add much.  I can\\'t see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn\\'t, it is more of a distraction than a help.(Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show.) I\\'m surprised Amazon didn\\'t make this a little more useful than it is.  Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money.\",0\\r\\n1449,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,I love it. It does everything.,1\\r\\n1450,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,Thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. Not much better than the Echo dot. Not worth the money.,0\\r\\n1451,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,\"I purchased echo about 2 weeks ago , I love this product, I would definitely recommend\",1\\r\\n1452,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,\"I\\'m loving my new Echo Show. The video screen adds so much more value and potential. Movies, tv shows, song lyrics, all extra features that are available with the Echo Show. Oh, it also has a built in camera for taking pics.\",1\\r\\n1453,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,\"My wife has been using Skype for years to talk to her parents daily, with constant technical issues.  Since her father is 88, it\\'s a lot to ask the man to uninstall/reinstall/reconfigure Skype, but he does.  When I saw these on sale, I jumped on them.  My wife was resistant to &#34;learn a new technology&#34;, but I told her these just work - like the video phones I saw at the New York World\\'s Fair in 1964 - 54 years ago!Yesterday it set up quickly and worked fine, with no issues.  My wife told her co-worker today and she went out and bought 3 - one for herself and her husband, and one for each set of parents.

Great sound.  Love the shopping list,1\\r\\n1459,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,\"The Echo Show is ok, however the constant suggestions about what to ask Alexa are sooooo annoying and there is no way to eliminate it. Also, I thought I could have the weather for an area displayed continuously,  but I have to talk to Alexa, which I don\\'t want to do in the middle of the night. Had I payed full price it would have been returned. There are other features that are nice, but I may never use them.\",1\\r\\n1460,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,We held off purchasing an Echo but couldn\\'t resist during Prime Days.

Do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased? I have no idea of the echo show\\'s capabilities. I have it linked to my Hue lights, but have no idea what commands will work, and what won\\'t. I purchased a Fire TV Stick along with the Show, but have no idea how to maximize the two. Just a few examples.I even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful. Seems way too basic to me, but better than a kick in the pants.\",1\\r\\n1470,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,It\\'s a fun item to have.  Has a lot of udefulness.

It’s awesome so far,1\\r\\n1472,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,\"Alexa Show is amazing. My wife hated that I bought it, thought we didn\\'t need it and after a day she fell in love with Alexa too lol.

In my opinion you should be able to tell the echo show what you need done. and the echo show does it. every time i ask for something I am referred back to the alexa app.on your mobile device, which I cannot access.To me this is not intelagence but dependence on other equipment to function.Every thing today is pushed to the phone,  because the phone has been made accessable,  to all those who wish  to gather information\",1\\r\\n1479,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,Great in the kitchen.  I love to cook and it is fun to look up recipes.  Also great for listening to music and watching shows on Amazon Prime Video while I cook.

I’m going off to live on campus for school in the fall and we got two of these to serve as an easy way to connect. Some people might not like the camera but that makes little sense. We carry devices with cameras all the time. The only difference here is that the item is stationary. My family and I also find the drop-in feature a comfort rather than an invasion of privacy. It’s definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versa.I’d also like to thank Amazon for including their VoiceView screen reader on the device. The Show would be a lot less blind friendly, even with Alexa present, if they hadn’t included that.We are an echo-loving household with two dots, three echos, and now two Shows. I wouldn’t be surprised if we got more in the future for ourselves or loved ones.

I have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months,  but the Show is so much better.  The sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4K tv.  I love being able to see my timers, events and list instead of having them read to me.  I purchased this on prime day, and it is worth every penny.  When the dot was given to me, I thought \"\"this is a cute novelty,  but I\\'ll probably never use it\"\". Was I wrong!!  Echo is part of my daily routine,  and has made my life so much easier.\",1\\r\\n1561,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,\"So far I’m very pleased with my Echo Show.  The problem is, there’s so much it can do that I haven’t been able to explore the extent of its abilities! I got the special price as part of the Prime Day promotion...and you just can’t beat what you get for the price.  Very pleased with the sound. The video screen is sharp. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get Alexa to perform a command...but as I get to know the system better, I’m hoping that will improve.  One drawback in the music...I’ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  Example: Secret Agent Man by Johnny Rivers...a “live”version is used, not the original version.  If I’m going to pay for Prime Music...I’d like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  Or at least give me a choice of what I want to hear.  Otherwise, I am very pleased with my Echo Show.  So pleased in fact, that I bought a second one!\",1\\r\\n1562,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,\"I like everything, about this !

Although I haven\\'t and probably won\\'t use the video functions. I had hoped that the display would be allow for more customization. It does not and is very limited. I would like the clock and weather to display in large text all of the time, it only displays in very small text. It also always has a line that says &#34;Tell Alexa to do this, or that&#34;, tips at the bottom of the screen. I would like to see that go away, but it won\\'t. Sound quality is good, not as good as the big Echo, but good enough. I bought it on sale and think I got value for what I paid.

I bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.

I also use it to check for different recipes, listen to music and my all time favorite.... telling everyone it is time for dinner. My son gets a real kick out of that!I know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment, but remember the original echo didn\\'t have what it has now when it first came out. I see that Amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon I am sure it will have all that we want very soon.... maybe even things we haven\\'t thought of!I do wish it was a bit more user friendly. I still haven\\'t figured out how to video chat with my cousin in North Carolina who also has one, and when I tried to call my son\\'s dot it went to video chat immediately, last I looked, dots don\\'t have video screens!Another thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep, it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill I had enabled that was free.

The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that\\'s an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes.

What fantastic potential these have - for digital photo screen, video calls, easy accesss to music, audio books, etc. However, once we have them setup, we discovered the huge lurking negative.  Amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their Alexa features.  You can turn off many other things in settins, but you cannot turn off &#34;Things to Try&#34;.

Commands between tv and the show get mixed (asking to watch something will turn my directv, not display on show which stinks with an 8 year old) Also would like more video options with flash briefings. Still really a tech wonder for a low price.\",1\\r\\n1630,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,Love that you can play music and see the lyrics.

Works perfectly in every regard. Resolution and sound both better than expected. Highly recommend.,1\\r\\n1633,4,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,\"Works well, pictures awesome! Sound could be better.

This is good for sleeping.\",1\\r\\n1637,3,29-Jul-18,White  Show,\"The ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by Google search has spoiled me.I had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the Echo.Not so, the ability of Alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package.Perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates.\",1\\r\\n1638,5,29-Jul-18,White  Show,\"My daughter has an Echo Show and she told me how much she loved it. I bought a white one for my kitchen and absolutely love it!  It has all the features of the others plus great extras. The sound system is awesome. I also own the original Echo Tower, Dots and Spot.

It\\'s perfect and getting better all the time.\",1\\r\\n1641,4,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,The ase of participating with Echo,1\\r\\n1642,3,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,\"I like the weather options but Alexa search compacity needs improvement. She aint no Google. Alexa gets our requests probably around 20% of the time. Currently Alexa doesn\\'t do YouTube either. This is a huge drawback and why The echo show dropped in price.  International radio via tune in is awesome but again her search engine, its like pulling teeth to get to anything.\",1\\r\\n1643,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,Love it!!,1\\r\\n1644,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,LOVE!! i still haven\\'t figured out all the best things we can do with it.,1\\r\\n1645,5,29-Jul-18,White  Show,\"Easy to use, Answers all my questions,Hands free, What\\'s not to like , It may not be perfect but it is  a sign of the times to come, can be connected to smart home items, I enjoy it totallly,, Keeps your home connected\",1\\r\\n1646,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,This product is amazing!

It was simple to setup and more inviting to use with the visual interface.  The Echo is being used as the primary interface for my connected home system which is currently only controlling lights and switches.  I look forward to expanding on that capability.  We also use it for maintaining lists, as a music player, general information, and entertainment.

I have a white kitchen, so now I have this stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb black power cord. For aesthetic purposes, I was happier with my year-old white Echo (not Show) because it came with a white powercord. This seems like a major design flaw in the “white” option. I strongly urge Amazon to change out the powercord to white.\",1\\r\\n1663,5,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,I am very pleased with the Echo Show! I love that it has so many nice features.

And I love AMAZON because my Echo Show went bonkers and all it took was a brief chat and Voila, a new one to replace it is on the way.

A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, I used it like I use my other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh.\",0\\r\\n1745,4,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,Love it to play music works great for finding recipes.

It\\'s also a little harder for it to pick up what you\\'re saying.

After days of the “oops, something went wrong” command.. we returned them and bought the Amazon Echo Show and the Echo Plus... so easy to set up! It connected immediately to my amazon account and was way easier to navigate. They both understand commands from my husband on the first try and have yet to give an error message.

I think I heard her sigh in exasperation.I tried to create a playlist of songs I like only to have it ignored.  I am learning workarounds but they are mediocre, at best...and, as yet do not include a personal playlist.I have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic Alexa than am I.So far, I like what I have been able to use but I\\'d like it a lot more if I could configure it to my needs, rather than accepting the Amazon/Alexa default.Karen\",1\\r\\n1792,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Very satisfied with the purchase.

A few times Alexa picked up something from TV, and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things. If you call something &#34;light&#34; in the app you need to say light, not &#34;lights.&#34; Echo Plus has no problems as a smart hub but I could use better user directions.

It controller music when I need it too. With a great sounding 360 speaker. I also bought a 4k fire TV and it can open Amazon prime video or Netflix at any moment. The included hue lighting makes this product even better. I found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room. The addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer. Alexa will controll it all as soon as you say \"\"Hey Alexa\"\". And if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device. This is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort.\",1\\r\\n1810,5,29-Jul-18,White  Plus,\"Amazon Music is great.

I chose a Kwikset 888 because Amazon said it was compatible and I bought 2 Dots while I was at it.  And when I posed the question, somebody in the community said it will work with Alexa.  What I didn\\'t know was the Z-wave lock and Zigbee Alexa hub weren\\'t compatible.  Does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with Echo Plus?  If not, I guess my choices are: 1. Exchange the Plus for a regular Echo and buy a separate hub like Wink.  2. Return the whole Alexa system and get something else.I  don\\'t want to just buy another hub to use along side my Echo Plus or I\\'ll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs.The reason I kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because I was afraid they wouldn\\'t operate seamlessly and unfortunately I only do enough research after something doesn\\'t work.\",0\\r\\n1815,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,This Echo Plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life!,1\\r\\n1816,5,29-Jul-18,White  Plus,\"I purchased the Amazon Echo Plus on Amazon prime day because I need a hub. I\\'m in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home. For the same price as some hub\\'s, and even less expensive in some other cases. I got a hub that works with my devices, plus it does a lot more. I haven\\'t even had time to go through all the skills it has, but I\\'ve already found myself using many of them. When I started a search for a hub. I wasn\\'t even considering the Echo. In part, because I didn\\'t know it was a hub. But also because I didn\\'t really think I would find much use for another AI system. If you\\'re looking for a hub. Why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost\\'s the same or less than other hubs? Oh! And by the way. For the same price as the Amazon Echo Plus alone. I found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug. Given the price of these extras. Well, that just put the Echo Plus over the top.\",1\\r\\n1817,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,\"I\\'m so happy that I purchased Alexa.  When I recently saw this at a friend\\'s home, he played some music while talking about the product.

It can also dim them with voice commands. I also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that I didn’t purchased  audibles for. I like that it can play my music from Amazon music, pandora, tunein, I heart radio and Spotify. Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered.  The only three dislikes that I have is that if you’re up too close or to far the echo doesn’t respond. So I think they need to improve the microphone. And I wish the speaker was better. The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus. This error was Sorry I’m having trouble understanding you please try again later. After research online I learned it was a problem connecting to my internet. And it was easy to find this out.

Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great!  I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs.  But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus.  I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices.  The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work..  The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work.

You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.I still love the echo and have zero complaints about the Alexa functionality or sound quality of this device. I\\'m only disappointed with the hub\\'s functionalities.\",0\\r\\n1911,4,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Still needs some work on commands.

I\\'m no audiophile by any means so maybe it\\'s that, but I think it sounds great considering the size. It fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear. I haven\\'t had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands. I have it paired to an EcoBee3, my Firestick, and a Phillip\\'s Hue light bulb.

Will update if I run into issues.\",1\\r\\n1929,4,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,I love my Echo Plus.

We admit that we have not explored all that\\'s available through the Echo.  One irritating issue is that Alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system, rather it refers you to the Alexa app or help via a computer.  It was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful.\",1\\r\\n1942,4,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,I like how easy it was to set up.

Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it\\'s fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you.\",0\\r\\n1946,5,26-Jul-18,White  Plus,Nothing to dislike I love my new toy that has made my house a smart home.,1\\r\\n1947,3,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,The built in hub lacks some of the features (geo fencing) of the Phillips hub.

The hue hub is a disaster.  It worked for a few months and then nothing.  I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one =y to have to send it in for repair.  I am now trying to reconnect my lights.  What a pain.  I am having to reset each light bulb.  It can take up to 5 times to get it to reset.  I have spent hours on this.  I will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful.  Stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps.,0\\r\\n1952,5,25-Jul-18,Black  Plus,I love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too!!

The only reason I purchased this is because it works so well and I wanted it in other rooms as well. All my switches work great and I have had not issues. I the past, I did have some ghost commands when Alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but I think some recent ipdates May have resolved this. It just keeps improving over time, not with call capabilities. I work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest, best way so far. Can’t wait to see what they come up with next.\",1\\r\\n1958,5,25-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Love it.

I use it to turn my lights on and off around the house.  It works with all the other Alexa devices, so I can give a command near any of them, and this will process the request.

However this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the Bluetooth in my sound bar for my TV which provides extra sound for music, I can make calls and finally hear people when home. I do not have cable, only the paid apps like Netflix and Hulu so when Alexa provided me news stations, weather and other updates it was really great to hear! I have linked all of my accounts to her, she turns on my lights before I walk through the door. She purchases re-orders off of Amazon for my pets and I heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to 911 regardless if she was unplugged or not.  This is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone.  My tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her.

The hub can\\'t be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge.  I can\\'t even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so.  There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  Bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  It doesn\\'t support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn\\'t do many functions that a dedicated one will, what\\'s the point?  I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn\\'t.

I am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my Nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. I wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. They are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. Although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the Echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. Thank God, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. Thank you Amazon. I will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from Affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house. Jeff Bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability I was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event. really helped when all you earn a month is $672 on SSDI thank you all again.\",1\\r\\n1983,2,23-Jul-18,Black  Plus,\"I\\'m sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won\\'t get to try this one.

Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don\\'t need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs.\",1\\r\\n1987,5,23-Jul-18,Black  Plus, ,1\\r\\n1988,4,22-Jul-18,Black  Plus,I love it but does not play well with my Amazon Prime... many shortcomings and potential fees,1\\r\\n1989,5,22-Jul-18,White  Plus,Item as described and delivered on time.

It’ll play pandora and Spotify but it’s limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptionDoes not stream YouTube music or YouTube audioApple users will be disappointed to see that it’s not as convenient as an apple deviceOverall, I still loved the device but I’ll be getting the DOT which has an audio out jack (as does the echo plus) and just connect to external speakers\",1\\r\\n1996,2,21-Jul-18,Black  Plus,\"I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb.  The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn\\'t work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn\\'t the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn\\'t locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can\\'t get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can\\'t believe I didn\\'t find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.

They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don\\'t really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don\\'t think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the  original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.\",1\\r\\n2005,2,20-Jul-18,White  Plus,\"Why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV\\'s and many other devices?  I want my money back!  This thing won\\'t even turn on my TV unless I buy another hub.  What\\'s the point of having a hub that doesn\\'t support half the devices out there?  DON\\'T buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub.  It won\\'t work with many of your devices.  Just by the Echo or Dot if you must but not this.  Better yet, get a Google device.

When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I’d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I’ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights.\",0\\r\\n2009,2,20-Jul-18,White  Plus,\"At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  I\\'d understand if the volume was set higher.  All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn\\'t sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.  Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem.\",0\\r\\n2010,5,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,\"the Sound is fantastic for the Classic  music. is like you have the orchestra at your home. and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top, but also you can tell  &#34;Alexa volume 3&#34;\",1\\r\\n2011,5,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,\"love Alexa, makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time\",1\\r\\n2012,3,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,\"I was suppose to get the “free” lightbulb with purchase. It did not come with Echo. Upon reading more carefully, it says to click a box to receive free bulb. 😳 of course I want the free bulb, who wouldn’t? Just a sneaky way for them to get out of having to give so many “ free”  bulbs away. Disappointed!  I have yet to set up my echo, our first purchase on any alexia device. Debating if we want to keep it. It did come quickly with my prime membership.\",1\\r\\n2013,1,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,I bought this for myself and i didn’t realize it had to be plugged in just to work.

The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It\\'s no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a \\'Group\\' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like \\'Thunderstorm sounds\\' and \\'Quote of the day\\' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it\\'s just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.\",1\\r\\n2017,4,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,Easy to Install. Very clear speaker.

I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x\\'s was enough, it shouldn\\'t be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....I hope they won\\'t call me I\\'ll tell em to send the product back!\",0\\r\\n2022,5,19-Jul-18,Black  Plus,\"Pretty cool device.

Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I\\'d wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I\\'m convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don\\'t miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn\\'t been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I\\'ll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can\\'t really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it\\'s unplugged. Haven\\'t tried it yet, although I don\\'t think it\\'ll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I\\'m using right now. So far I\\'m loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed.\",1\\r\\n2235,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Everything,1\\r\\n2236,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Love this!,1\\r\\n2237,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Really enjoying my firestick can’t wait to get rid of  cable such a waste of money.,1\\r\\n2238,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Good,1\\r\\n2239,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Love it!,1\\r\\n2240,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Easy to set up and use.,1\\r\\n2241,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,WooHoo! $20 on Prime Day; done!,1\\r\\n2242,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Perfect,1\\r\\n2243,5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,Very easy to use!

I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can\\'t use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It\\'s very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could.

After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it\\'s little rough patch and I haven\\'t had any problems since.

Customer service couldn\\'t help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.\",0\\r\\n2492,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"It won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won’t work\",1\\r\\n2493,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I\\'ve only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it.

I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this.

It\\'s a great product.,1\\r\\n2502,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"What can I say. Well, I’m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.\",1\\r\\n2503,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Great product,1\\r\\n2504,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.\",1\\r\\n2505,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.

The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam.\",1\\r\\n2506,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don\\'t like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts.

I know some people complained about the speaker I\\'m not sure why. I\\'m sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough.

So awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. But like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume.

So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”.\",0\\r\\n2559,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games.

The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six.

It’s amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.,1\\r\\n2604,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Convenient and fun.,1\\r\\n2605,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,It\\'s alright....,1\\r\\n2606,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,this is my first Alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!,1\\r\\n2607,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I love searching the Alexa skill shop on the app. Useful things like having Alexa turn my lights on and off, listening to news updates every morning. And fun stuff like telling Alexa to make the Star Trek red alert nois. Or playing song quiz with friends.\",1\\r\\n2608,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Second dot.,1\\r\\n2609,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Son loves it.,1\\r\\n2610,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I love how compact it is.,1\\r\\n2611,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn\\'t help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren\\'t willing to replace.\",0\\r\\n2612,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"It talks to me, plays the type of music i want to listen to, and even turns off when I ask if to.\",1\\r\\n2613,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station.

It’s a part of my daily routine,1\\r\\n2617,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder.\",1\\r\\n2618,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don’t have a “smart home” and don’t intend to make it one. But it’s fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.,1\\r\\n2619,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn\\'t have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn\\'t refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn\\'t work.,1\\r\\n2620,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Set up is so easy.,1\\r\\n2621,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love it,1\\r\\n2622,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I\\'m amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don\\'t keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.,1\\r\\n2623,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.,1\\r\\n2624,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!\",1\\r\\n2625,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"I\\'m finding more and more uses for this all the time. It keeps me informed with news and weather, I can get a daily Bible verse, and have it play music. New skills are added all the time. The future is here!\",1\\r\\n2626,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I love to watch my wife argue with Alexa.  I woke up one night listening to Alexa talking to my cell phone. ????,1\\r\\n2627,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot, ,1\\r\\n2628,1,30-Jul-18,White  Dot, ,0\\r\\n2629,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Gave as a gift - they loved it.,1\\r\\n2630,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,The Echo Dot was everything that I expected and more.,1\\r\\n2631,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier,1\\r\\n2632,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"I love my echo dot.

The sound is a little too low.,1\\r\\n2637,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"Handy if you don\\'t expect much out of it much \"\"dumber\"\" than the assistant in my phone.\",1\\r\\n2638,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It\\'s easy to set up and use. There are new features and skills added all the time.,1\\r\\n2639,3,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Love the product but dislike that I can’t sync up my Apple Music for Alexa to play,1\\r\\n2640,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Have had for just one week so far and I can say it is a blast to have.,1\\r\\n2641,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,love it,1\\r\\n2642,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Works like a charm.,1\\r\\n2643,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Good speaker for bedroom or office,1\\r\\n2644,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Small speaker tin sound.

Like the convenience!!,1\\r\\n2646,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It was easy to set up and affordable! Love it!,1\\r\\n2647,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I love that I can shut the microphone off at night so my children can’t talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music. Not sure how I survived with out this for so long.,1\\r\\n2648,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Echo Dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time.,1\\r\\n2649,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"The sound quality wasn’t great, but it was inexpensive\",1\\r\\n2650,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Works great... bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house.,1\\r\\n2651,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It isn’t bad for what it is. Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it’s not bad for the sale price I paid.,1\\r\\n2652,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It’s great but sound quality is very low,1\\r\\n2653,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I love it.,1\\r\\n2654,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"As Always, easy to set up\",1\\r\\n2655,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It works OK. This speaker quality is not much better than my iPhone X. I would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.,1\\r\\n2656,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Very intelligent, love the songs ....\",1\\r\\n2657,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Review,1\\r\\n2658,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I love my Echo Dot!  The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money.\",1\\r\\n2659,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.,0\\r\\n2660,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.,1\\r\\n2661,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill.\",1\\r\\n2662,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot, ,1\\r\\n2663,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,The commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I\\'m asking for.,1\\r\\n2664,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,HANDY AS HELL 10/10 RECOMMEND,1\\r\\n2665,1,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I\\'m not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I\\'m not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it\\'s been a very frustrating experience.,0\\r\\n2666,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed.\",1\\r\\n2667,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Totally gets out sense of humour,1\\r\\n2668,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,We put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don\\'t know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.,1\\r\\n2669,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven\\'t decided if I\\'ll keep it or not!\",1\\r\\n2670,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.,1\\r\\n2671,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Better sound.,1\\r\\n2672,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound.\",1\\r\\n2673,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I\\'d get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.\",0\\r\\n2674,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!\",1\\r\\n2675,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won\\'t turn them on but we\\'ve been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it\\'s convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I\\'m just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.\",1\\r\\n2676,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions.\",1\\r\\n2677,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker,1\\r\\n2678,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Alexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. 😂 Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.,1\\r\\n2679,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,small footprint.  nice clarity.,1\\r\\n2680,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Easy set up,1\\r\\n2681,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Great addition to my Alexa base. Using it in my guest bedroom for music, clock and info.Dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it\\'s a great value\",1\\r\\n2682,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn\\'t work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.,1\\r\\n2683,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can\\'t do.  It works well.,1\\r\\n2684,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven\\'t used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.,1\\r\\n2685,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Easy to set up and does everything it’s a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.,1\\r\\n2686,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"A great product for the price, works well!!\",1\\r\\n2687,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Perfect for a home office,1\\r\\n2688,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it\\'s lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.,0\\r\\n2689,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It does what it\\'s suppose to do great product.,1\\r\\n2690,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered another.,1\\r\\n2691,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Love the dot,1\\r\\n2692,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Great item.  I\\'m so glad I made the purchase and on Prime day.,1\\r\\n2693,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I\\'m still learning how to use it.  I figured out it can read my kindle books to me, which is a real bonus.\",1\\r\\n2694,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. Great to drop in on family around the house.,1\\r\\n2695,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I\\'m still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have.\",1\\r\\n2696,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Echo Dot responds to us when we aren\\'t even talking to it. I\\'ve unplugged it. It feels like it\\'s &#34;spying&#34; on us.,0\\r\\n2697,1,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(,0\\r\\n2698,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won\\'t regret this at all!\",1\\r\\n2699,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Perfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.,1\\r\\n2700,3,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time,1\\r\\n2701,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love it!,1\\r\\n2702,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I\\'m addicted to this thing.,1\\r\\n2703,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn\\'t give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I\\'m just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn\\'t take up a whole lot of space.,1\\r\\n2704,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,So far all.i can say is I love it,1\\r\\n2705,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... AMAZON, IHeart Radio, Pandora.\",1\\r\\n2706,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Great to play music throughout the house. Great and easily fits in my decor of my home,1\\r\\n2707,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"I\\'m obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????\",1\\r\\n2708,3,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Works well. Just disappointed with the speaker quality. But hooked it up to old computer speakers.,1\\r\\n2709,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do\",1\\r\\n2710,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,We have so much fun with this!  So easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to Alexa!!,1\\r\\n2711,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I love my new Echo Dot! Right now, I mainly use it to play music at night, but it gets the job done.\",1\\r\\n2712,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price.\",1\\r\\n2713,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It’s great for my news updates too!,1\\r\\n2714,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It works just like my other Dots.,1\\r\\n2715,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Set up was simple. It recognizes my voice well. It seams very intuitive. I am enjoying its ease of use.,1\\r\\n2716,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.,0\\r\\n2717,3,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.,1\\r\\n2718,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"I like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song I can think of and much more. I wish the sound could be a tad louder.\",1\\r\\n2719,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Too soon, I\\'m still learning what I can do with it.\",1\\r\\n2720,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.

Just what I needed!,1\\r\\n2759,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it’s great that I was able to set that as default. There’s not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He’s a lot more calmer and doesn’t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It’s a must have!\",1\\r\\n2760,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love it.  It works great.

There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.,1\\r\\n2779,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Use the product for music and it’s great!,1\\r\\n2780,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Easy to set-up and to use.,1\\r\\n2781,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It works great!!,1\\r\\n2782,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.,1\\r\\n2783,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,PHENOMENAL,1\\r\\n2784,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I loved it does exactly what it says,1\\r\\n2785,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I used it to control my smart home devices.

I named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems.\",1\\r\\n2797,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"Only complaint I have is that the sound quality isn\\'t great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don\\'t mind the audio quality, but if you\\'re bothered by that kind of thing I\\'d go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers.\",1\\r\\n2798,4,29-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Good,1\\r\\n2799,5,29-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Nice little unit  no issues,1\\r\\n2800,5,31-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"The echo dot was easy to set up and use.

Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true.

I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I\\'m learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied.

She works great so far.,1\\r\\n2829,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can\\'t use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It\\'s very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could.

SHE ROCKS!!!,1\\r\\n2839,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it\\'s little rough patch and I haven\\'t had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.\",1\\r\\n2840,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Small size works great in our sunroom.,1\\r\\n2841,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I like it and it’s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.,1\\r\\n2842,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn\\'t help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.\",0\\r\\n2843,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"It won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won’t work\",1\\r\\n2844,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I\\'ve only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa\",1\\r\\n2845,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills.

Great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  Or listen to CNN live with Serius SM.,1\\r\\n2849,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I\\'m going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.,1\\r\\n2850,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,It plays music that I request.,1\\r\\n2851,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I didn\\'t like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.,0\\r\\n2852,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Luv it.  It\\'s a great product.,1\\r\\n2853,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"What can I say. Well, I’m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.\",1\\r\\n2854,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Great product,1\\r\\n2855,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.\",1\\r\\n2856,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam.\",1\\r\\n2857,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don\\'t like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more.

I\\'m a little behind the times I\\'ve never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It\\'s pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I\\'m not sure why. I\\'m sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough.

So awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. But like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I’m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo.

Love them,1\\r\\n2907,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,The ease in installing,1\\r\\n2908,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,información de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet.\",1\\r\\n2909,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”.\",0\\r\\n2910,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don\\'t like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it\\'s an ok item.\",1\\r\\n2911,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Love the echo dot it’s amaxing!!!,1\\r\\n2912,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what\\'s new.  The one thing I don\\'t like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.\",1\\r\\n2913,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Just like it\\'s big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room.\",1\\r\\n2914,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It does everything  the big guy does,1\\r\\n2915,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Great product - understands my accent!,1\\r\\n2916,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love it... can\\'t stop using it..,1\\r\\n2917,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Really like the availability to get instant music throughout the house.,1\\r\\n2918,3,30-Jul-18,White  Dot, ,1\\r\\n2919,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps.\",1\\r\\n2920,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Cool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!,1\\r\\n2921,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It is s great tool helping with information.,1\\r\\n2922,1,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Used twice not working!!!!!!!,0\\r\\n2923,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life.

Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock.\",0\\r\\n2946,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it\\'s not awkward, and it doesn\\'t take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.\",1\\r\\n2947,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker.

It’s a part of my daily routine,1\\r\\n2968,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder.\",1\\r\\n2969,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don’t have a “smart home” and don’t intend to make it one. But it’s fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.,1\\r\\n2970,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn\\'t have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn\\'t refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn\\'t work.,1\\r\\n2971,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Set up is so easy.,1\\r\\n2972,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love it,1\\r\\n2973,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I\\'m amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don\\'t keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.,1\\r\\n2974,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.,1\\r\\n2975,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!\",1\\r\\n2976,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"I\\'m finding more and more uses for this all the time.

Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it’s not bad for the sale price I paid.,1\\r\\n3003,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It’s great but sound quality is very low,1\\r\\n3004,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I love it.,1\\r\\n3005,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"As Always, easy to set up\",1\\r\\n3006,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It works OK.

The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money.\",1\\r\\n3010,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.,0\\r\\n3011,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Easy installation and set up.

Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I\\'m not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I\\'m not sure&#34;.

It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don\\'t know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.,1\\r\\n3020,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven\\'t decided if I\\'ll keep it or not!\",1\\r\\n3021,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.,1\\r\\n3022,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Better sound.,1\\r\\n3023,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.

I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.\",0\\r\\n3025,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!\",1\\r\\n3026,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won\\'t turn them on but we\\'ve been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it\\'s convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I\\'m just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.\",1\\r\\n3027,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions.\",1\\r\\n3028,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Small convenient and dependable.

I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.,1\\r\\n3034,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can\\'t do.  It works well.,1\\r\\n3035,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven\\'t used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.,1\\r\\n3036,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Easy to set up and does everything it’s a poster.

Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it\\'s lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.,0\\r\\n3040,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It does what it\\'s suppose to do great product.,1\\r\\n3041,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.

Great to drop in on family around the house.,1\\r\\n3046,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I\\'m still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have.\",1\\r\\n3047,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Echo Dot responds to us when we aren\\'t even talking to it. I\\'ve unplugged it.

My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won\\'t regret this at all!\",1\\r\\n3050,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Perfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.,1\\r\\n3051,3,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time,1\\r\\n3052,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love it!,1\\r\\n3053,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I\\'m addicted to this thing.,1\\r\\n3054,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn\\'t give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I\\'m just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn\\'t take up a whole lot of space.,1\\r\\n3055,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,So far all.i can say is I love it,1\\r\\n3056,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... AMAZON, IHeart Radio, Pandora.\",1\\r\\n3057,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Great to play music throughout the house. Great and easily fits in my decor of my home,1\\r\\n3058,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"I\\'m obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????\",1\\r\\n3059,3,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Works well. Just disappointed with the speaker quality. But hooked it up to old computer speakers.,1\\r\\n3060,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do\",1\\r\\n3061,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,We have so much fun with this!  So easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to Alexa!!,1\\r\\n3062,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I love my new Echo Dot! Right now, I mainly use it to play music at night, but it gets the job done.\",1\\r\\n3063,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price.\",1\\r\\n3064,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It’s great for my news updates too!,1\\r\\n3065,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It works just like my other Dots.,1\\r\\n3066,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Set up was simple. It recognizes my voice well. It seams very intuitive. I am enjoying its ease of use.,1\\r\\n3067,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.,0\\r\\n3068,3,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.,1\\r\\n3069,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"I like that she has the ability to do multiple different things like create a to do list, set and alarm, play any song I can think of and much more. I wish the sound could be a tad louder.\",1\\r\\n3070,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Too soon, I\\'m still learning what I can do with it.\",1\\r\\n3071,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.,1\\r\\n3072,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices,1\\r\\n3073,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Works great!,1\\r\\n3074,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I like almost everything,1\\r\\n3075,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"AMAZING. It has helped me become better organized, gives me traffic updates, weather updates, and helps me maintain a good, fast morning routine.\",1\\r\\n3076,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions\",1\\r\\n3077,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Great. Definitely gets a little old after a while but for $30 I can\\'t really regret it at all. Love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to The Smiths.,1\\r\\n3078,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love it. Added it to an upstairs bedroom,1\\r\\n3079,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house,1\\r\\n3080,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Works great and easy to set up!,1\\r\\n3081,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,My 3rd echo device. Very easy to set up.

I don’t know what the original larger Alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities.,1\\r\\n3085,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Really like it,1\\r\\n3086,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"Works as expected. This is our fourth one, our son loves it in his room. Easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it.\",1\\r\\n3087,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love it,1\\r\\n3088,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Dislike the volume. It does not sound loud enough.,1\\r\\n3089,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love Alexa!!  I own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit!,1\\r\\n3090,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,as expected,1\\r\\n3091,1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I didn’t order it,0\\r\\n3092,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I love this technology. I\\'m older, but this is so easy to set up and use. I have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything I use my echo for which is in the living room.\",1\\r\\n3093,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Use as my 3rd dot. Bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and doesn\\'t have access to phone.,1\\r\\n3094,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Amazing product. Still learnimg all the things it can do,1\\r\\n3095,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Does what I expected, and more.\",1\\r\\n3096,1,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn’t need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.,0\\r\\n3097,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I have a friend now.,1\\r\\n3098,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,It’s easier to do things with it,1\\r\\n3099,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Good device,1\\r\\n3100,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Overall love it. There are just some commands which aren\\'t effective. It may be part user error or \"\"Alexa\"\" becoming accustom to what is being asked.\",1\\r\\n3101,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn\\'t be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs.\",1\\r\\n3102,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices.\",1\\r\\n3103,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"I love it, it is just what I thought it would be!!!  I\\'m addicted!\",1\\r\\n3104,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"Works beautifully, excellent sound.\",1\\r\\n3105,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Still learning everything she can do.  Good for a room.  Volume is pretty good without an additional speaker,1\\r\\n3106,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,neat tool we enjoy it with the family,1\\r\\n3107,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Easy to connect and the skills created for our Echo 2nd Gen worked fine with the Dot.,1\\r\\n3108,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"I live alone, this is the best companion!\",1\\r\\n3109,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Easy to set up and connect with smart devices. Just what I needed!,1\\r\\n3110,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,\"Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it’s great that I was able to set that as default. There’s not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He’s a lot more calmer and doesn’t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It’s a must have!\",1\\r\\n3111,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I\\'m not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.,1\\r\\n3112,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,This  is my second Echo to purchase -- the price was so cheap -- I\\'m seriously thinking of buying 2 more -- I use &#34;Alexa&#34; for everything -- it\\'s the next best thing to the internet  :-*,1\\r\\n3113,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself,1\\r\\n3114,3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot, ,1\\r\\n3115,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It is just not as loud as I thought it was going to be.,1\\r\\n3116,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I enjoy it. Still discovering new uses.,1\\r\\n3117,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom,1\\r\\n3118,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,\"excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns\",1\\r\\n3119,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It\\'s pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but doesn\\'t understand my commands some of the time.,1\\r\\n3120,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot, ,1\\r\\n3121,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I like the hands free operation vs the Tap.

I have yet to hook it up to my TV or lights but look forward to doing so.,1\\r\\n3126,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot, ,1\\r\\n3127,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.,1\\r\\n3128,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,Outstanding product - easy to use.  works great,1\\r\\n3129,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,We have six of these throughout our home and they are great.  There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.,1\\r\\n3130,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Use the product for music and it’s great!,1\\r\\n3131,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,Easy to set-up and to use.,1\\r\\n3132,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,It works great!!,1\\r\\n3133,4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.,1\\r\\n3134,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,PHENOMENAL,1\\r\\n3135,5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,I loved it does exactly what it says,1\\r\\n3136,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,I used it to control my smart home devices.
